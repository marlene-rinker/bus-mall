### Lab 11 - April 13, 2020

Set up html and js to display three random products 25 times.
Ask the user to vote on which product they like out of the ones shown by clicking on it.
Do this 25 times.
Display the results in a list.

Set up some very basic CSS for this. The main focus was on the functionality.
